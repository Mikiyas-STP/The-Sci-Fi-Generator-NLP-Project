# 🪐 Sci-Fi Story Generator (NLP Final Project)

This is a creative NLP project that uses an RNN (LSTM) model to generate sci-fi story text based on classic literature. Built for the "Natural Language Processing for Creatives" course in the Peckham DAZ Programme 2025.

## 🔧 How It Works
- Loads and cleans a public domain sci-fi text
- Tokenizes and sequences the text
- Trains an LSTM model to predict the next word
- Generates creative story snippets from a custom seed

## 📂 Project Structure
- `notebook/` - Jupyter Notebook for model training and generation
- `report/` - Final project report
- `exercises/` - Class and homework notebooks
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
